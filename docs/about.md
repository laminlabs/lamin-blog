# About

Lamin Reports publishes reports on data science & engineering in biology (online only, open access).

Unlike blog posts, reports require academic attribution of related work and scientific writing.

Unlike traditional journal articles (but like preprints), reports do not undergo a formal peer-review process.

Published reports are registered on CrossRef and citable through DOIs.

Editors: Alex Wolf & Sunny Sun.
