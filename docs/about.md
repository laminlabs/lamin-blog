Lamin Reports publishes papers on data science & engineering in biology (online only, open access).

Unlike blog posts, reports require academic attribution and scientific writing.

Unlike traditional journal articles (but like preprints), reports do not undergo a formal peer-review process.

Published reports are registered on CrossRef and citable through DOIs.

Editors: Alex Wolf & Sunny Sun.
